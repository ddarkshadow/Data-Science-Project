# Data-Science-Project
This project will enhance your data science skills ---(having the week1 and week2)

The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
 
Dataset Description
The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.
 
Variables
Description
Pregnancies
Number of times pregnant
Glucose
Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness
Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin
Two hour serum insulin
BMI
Body Mass Index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Diabetes pedigree function
Age
Age in years
Outcome
Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0
 
 
 Task 1
Data Exploration:
1. Perform descriptive analysis. Understand the variables and their corresponding values. On the columns below, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value:
• Glucose
• BloodPressure
• SkinThickness
• Insulin
• BMI
2. Visually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.
3. There are integer and float data type variables in this dataset. Create a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables. 

Task 2
Data Exploration:
1. Check the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Describe your findings and plan future course of action.
2. Create scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Describe your findings.
3. Perform correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.
